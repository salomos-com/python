# Unit Tests for salomos.py

This document provides an overview of the unit tests for the `salomos.py` module, specifically for the `DSLProcessor` class.

## Overview

The test suite is implemented using Python's built-in `unittest` framework. The main test class is `TestDSLProcessor`, which contains various test methods to verify the functionality of the `DSLProcessor` class.

## Test Cases

### 1. test_init_database

**Purpose**: Verifies that the necessary database tables are created during initialization.

**What it tests**: 
- Checks if the 'sentences' and 'objects' tables are created in the SQLite database.

### 2. test_load_sentence

**Purpose**: Tests the loading and processing of sentences from the database.

**What it tests**:
- Inserts a test sentence into the database.
- Verifies that the sentence can be loaded correctly.
- Checks if the loaded sentence is marked as processed in the database.

### 3. test_load_objects

**Purpose**: Verifies the loading of objects from the database.

**What it tests**:
- Inserts test objects into the database.
- Checks if the objects are loaded correctly with their respective values.

### 4. test_resolve_class_name

**Purpose**: Tests the method that converts space-separated words to CamelCase.

**What it tests**:
- Checks if "example module" is correctly converted to "ExampleModule".
- Checks if "math operations" is correctly converted to "MathOperations".

### 5. test_find_matching_element

**Purpose**: Verifies the functionality of finding matching elements in the imported elements.

**What it tests**:
- Checks if existing elements like "Example Module" and "example function" are found.
- Verifies that non-existent elements return None.

### 6. test_process_sentence

**Purpose**: Tests the core functionality of processing DSL sentences.

**What it tests**:
- Processing a built-in method (add).
- Processing an imported function (example_function).
- Processing a class method (ExampleModule.greet).
- Processing a nested class method (ExampleModule.MathOperations.multiply).

### 7. test_dsl_methods

**Purpose**: Tests the built-in DSL methods of the DSLProcessor.

**What it tests**:
- Verifies the functionality of the `add` method.
- Checks the `concatenate` method.

## Running the Tests

To run the test suite, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the root directory of the project.
3. Run the following command:

   ```
   python -m unittest tests.test_salomos
   ```

4. The test results will be displayed in the console, showing which tests passed or failed.

## Notes

- The tests use an in-memory SQLite database to avoid interfering with any existing database.
- Some tests may need to be adjusted based on the exact implementation of certain methods (e.g., logging behavior).

## Future Improvements

- Add more edge cases and error handling tests.
- Implement mock objects to isolate tests from external dependencies.
- Add performance tests for larger datasets.
- Expand test coverage as new features are added to the `DSLProcessor` class.

Remember to update these tests and this documentation whenever significant changes are made to `salomos.py` to maintain good test coverage and ensure the reliability of the code.
